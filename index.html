        <h2>📈 Market Snapshot</h2>
        <p><strong>Markets in a Fog: Tariffs, Inflation, and the Fed's Balancing Act</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tariff Turmoil:</strong> The U.S. has imposed a 10% baseline tariff on most imports, with higher rates for key trading partners. China faces a 145% tariff, leading to significant market sell-offs and a surge in Treasury yields.</li>
            <li><strong>Fed's Wait-and-See Approach:</strong> Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized patience in adjusting interest rates, citing the need to evaluate the economic impact of the new tariffs. The Fed is balancing the dual threats of higher inflation and slower growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Reaction:</strong> The S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced declines, with tech stocks like Nvidia being particularly affected due to export restrictions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>📝 Sean's Notes</h2>
        <p><strong>Steady as She Goes</strong></p>
        <p>Navigating the current market volatility requires a calm and measured approach. While headlines may cause short-term fluctuations, our focus remains on long-term growth through consistent investing in ETFs and dividend-paying stocks. Remember, building wealth the boring way is often the most sustainable path.</p>
