        <h2>📈 Market Snapshot</h2>
        <p><strong>Markets in a Fog: Tariffs, Inflation, and the Fed's Balancing Act</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tariff Turmoil:</strong> The U.S. has imposed a 10% baseline tariff on most imports, with higher rates for key trading partners. China faces a 145% tariff, leading to significant market sell-offs and a surge in Treasury yields.</li>
            <li><strong>Fed's Wait-and-See Approach:</strong> Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized patience in adjusting interest rates, citing the need to evaluate the economic impact of the new tariffs. The Fed is balancing the dual threats of higher inflation and slower growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Reaction:</strong> The S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced declines, with tech stocks like Nvidia being particularly affected due to export restrictions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>📝 Sean's Notes</h2>
        <p><strong>Consistency over flash.</strong></p>
        <p>This week was quiet — and sometimes that’s the best kind of progress. No dramatic moves, no panic, no FOMO. Just a slow, intentional stack. Keep investing. Keep showing up. Let time do the heavy lifting.</p>
